## Dataset 

I've chosen the sports, tech, and business categories from [BBC news dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pariza/bbc-news-summary), which together comprise 1422 news articles.

Description of the dataset: this dataset was created using a dataset used for data categorization that consists of 2225 documents from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas from 2004-2005 used in the paper of D. Greene and P. Cunningham. "Practical Solutions to the Problem of Diagonal Dominance in Kernel Document Clustering", Proc. ICML 2006; whose all rights, including copyright, in the content of the original articles are owned by the BBC.

Average number of words in news dataset = 378.03
