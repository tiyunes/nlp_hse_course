## Conclusions:

* The best model in terms of quality was the fine-tuned DistillBERT that demonstrated 0.82224 F1-score on the public part of the test dataset but that was the most biggest model in terms of parameters (overall number of parameters = 66.955.010)

* The best model in terms of balance between complexity and quality was the logistic regression model based on TF-IDF vector representations that shows f1 = 0.78945 on the public part of the test dataset but requires much less amount of parameters
